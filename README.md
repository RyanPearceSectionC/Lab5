# Welcome!
 This is my Lab Assignment for Week 5. This is the whole development process of what I did and what I feel like I would change.

## Making the File
First and foremost, I created an HTML and CSS file and immediately got started with the body color, the text and finally, started to work on my header.

## Header Creation
I wanted to try to do something a bit different which was to make it so when you hover, it would play an animation by sizing it up and making it less transparent. I managed to do it and make the Header sticky. I found a problem with Mobile which I will not fix unless I have enough time to do so which is that ::hover is not affected by tapping or mobile devices. I had an idea to use ::not() but I decided to hold off for now.

## Card Artist Creation
Just making cards for artists that just states their names and when the band was formed. Simple, no heavy research required.

## Card Song Creation
I made a basic card and plan to make it have the following:
    <ol>
        1. Song Title
        2. Author/Band Logo
        3. Album
        4. Author/Band Name
        5. Song Audio
    </ol>
Working on these cards, I have had a massive issue with the relative images using Picture which isn't going very well for me. For some reason, despite looking through different sources, even going as far as to copy said source and edit them to my images, none of them seem to work. I have a feeling that it's an issue with inheritance but unfortunately, without a lot of testing and time on my hands, I would've done my research into it. I am considering on researching it afterwards though. For now, I am stuck opting for low sized images. Actually, in the middle of writing this, I found a way to make a makeshift responsive image to my site. It might not be the 'picture' tag but it gets the job done simularly.

### Notice About Resources!
I have uploaded the resources in a channel on discord and used it as a means of keeping the files somewhere on the web. This will allow me to use these pretty much until the end of the world or until something happens to the channel.

## Footer
The footer will have a long disclaimer about the whole 'songs on the website' sort of thing, both just for fun and because I literally have songs in the website.

# Just a Quick Note
If you noticed a few things that might be a little strange like seeing '/ >' instead of just '>'. The reason for that is due to using Visual Studio rather than Visual Studio Code since it runs better on my desktop in comparison to Visual Studio Code (don't ask why, I don't know why) and the completion is '/ >'. I tried to remove them as I don't know exactly what it does or why they did it but I tried to stay true to what I knew. Last little bit is the beginning of the HTML with the lang="en" in HTML, I was looking through an Inspect Element and after glancing through it a little for fun saw a warning for it so I decided to look into it a little then just threw it in for fun.
