# Welcome!
 This is my Lab Assignment for Week 5. This is the whole development process of what I did and what I feel like I would change.

## Making the File
First and foremost, I created an HTML and CSS file and immediately got started with the body color, the text and finally, started to work on my header.

## Header Creation
I wanted to try to do something a bit different which was to make it so when you hover, it would play an animation by sizing it up and making it less transparent. I managed to do it and make the Header sticky. I found a problem with Mobile which I will not fix unless I have enough time to do so which is that ::hover is not affected by tapping or mobile devices. I had an idea to use ::not() but I decided to hold off for now.

## Card Creation
I made a basic card and plan to make it have the following:
    1. Song Title
    2. Author/Band Logo
    3. Album
    4. Author/Band Name
    5. Song Audio
